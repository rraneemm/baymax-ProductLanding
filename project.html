            <h1>How to deal with a kid's tanturum?</h1>
            <div>
                In every family's household we often hear the cries of a child blaring through the walls because the parent
            simply refused they
            insert their finger in the electric socket or burn the house down. On other days you can find your kid refusing
            to eat and crying
            all day because they're hungry! Usually they are going through a moody day or they are bothered by the lack of
            attention; however, this
            doesn't mean the solution is the give them attention, in most cases they have more than they need anyway.

            <h1>How to get your kid out of a tanturum?</h1>
            <div>
                Make sure you are on an eye level with your kid and hold them soflty and ask if they are okay. At this point the
            kid will start to calm down and talk to you.
            Ask them about their emotional state or if they are hurt and let them take their time responding.
            <dl stye="list-style-type:disc">
                <dt>If the kid wants something</dt>
                <dd>At this point the kid will not be screaming and can be answering your questions with what they want
                    instead.
                    <p>-Are you feeling okay?</p>
                    <p>=I want the chocolate bar.</p>
                    And it might sound something like this. Ignore his request and sowly repeat your question by stating you
                    just want to make sure they are okay first because you're worried.
                    This way they start getting distrated a little and use this thread and try your best distracting him by
                    pretending you fell down from crouching or you heard a noise or maybe even asking
                    to show him something in a different room.
                </dd>
                <dt>If you want the kid to do something</dt>
                <dd>This is usually what we all go through when we want our kids to get up, take a shower, eat their meal,
                    and whatever necessary things that need to be done. While we are planning their days
                    they just refuse doing anything and the best and most affective way is to make an illustrative
                    time-table of what they will be doing within the coming hour. Draw put objects related to the
                    action with stick people for more fun and put the paper somehwere clear so wehn one thing is checked off
                    we go back to it and point and say we are done with this now let's go to the next.

                </dd>
                <dt>Nothing is actually wrong</dt>
                <dd>When there is simply nothing wrong but the kid is all over the place they might just need their time to
                    let out all this crying or screaming energy as you are beside them and holding them to tell
                    them you are there for them no matter what.

            </dl>
            <p>
                <span>Note:</span>  if even after all the steps you did they go back to screaming or crying this is where you actually ignore them and look away like it is not bothering you and you know they are okay.No remarks or comments
                over their behaviour, just one mention of what they should be doing: dressing up, eating, in the shower, etc.

                    <p>
                        When you wake your kid up early, give him a quick shower, and let him have him breakfast; it makes your
                        kid active and in a good mood for the rest of the day as well as assigning timings for things.
                        For example: breakfast time, play time, lunch time, bed time. So, whenever it is time to go to sleep
                        they don't start requesting food or drink in order not to sleep.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Fill their day!</h3>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Have them busy with healthy activities during their day and in this way they will be healthy and
                        learnign new things as they enjoy their day and you will not go through tanturums at all! For ideas on
                        healthy activities

                    <p>
                        This point is directed towards those with kids above the age of 2 or even 1 and a hlaf in some cases.
                        When you are always there with your kid this can make them less social and anxious to stay with anyone
                        that is not you.
                        Let your kid do some solo activities as you are doing your own thing too!
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Show him the world!</h3>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Make sure that your kid goes out of the house every two days or maybe three. Let them go to different
                        places and meet new people. Whether it is a nice picnic in the park or a walk to the supermarket all the
                        way to a visit to
                        the playplace. Let them see people and interact with them, when you buy them things, tell them that you
                        are and have conversations with them and let them pick their items and colours.
